# [Reflect test] üéØ


## Basic Details

### Project Description
project is an Arduino-based reflex game that tests reaction speed.
It uses LEDs to give visual cues, a push button to record player responses, and two TM1637 displays ‚Äî one showing the countdown timer and the other showing the press count (score) in real time.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
I‚Äôm solving the age-old problem of deciding who‚Äôs the lightning-fast button-press champion at parties.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With the power of Arduino magic, lights that tease you, and a button that tattles on how slow you really are.
